# Unity-Past-Projects-and-Unfinished-Code
Unity projects I've made in the past.

Hello, if you're reading this... Welcome!

Making video games (or at least attempting at times lol) in the Unity Game Engine has been a hobby of mine since ~2017.
The source code for the scripts appear sloppy, that's because they are; I hope to reflect on my past work and identify how much I have improved as a programmer in the past years.

I'd be eager to hear your feedback and ask any questions if needed.

Thanks,

- Caleb
